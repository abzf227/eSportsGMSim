#eSportsGM
C# self-learning journey. My hope is that this game is finished in Godot or Unity with mechanics similar to basketball-gm.com, but with actual graphics rather than just number crunching. No prior C# experience but we'll make do.

In an alternate universe where eSports is more profitable & mainstream than it is in this one...with a hot new game on the rise and your boss unable to find someone cheaper, take control as the fresh new intern-turned-general-manager-and-head-coach(?) to lead your team to eSports glory! At least, that's the gist of it. I have a lot of mechanics I want to implement and tons of graphics while still retaining that "number crunching" aspect since that's what I found really addictive about basketball-gm.
